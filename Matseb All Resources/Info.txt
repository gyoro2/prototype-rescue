Welcome!

In this folder you will find a variety of resources, some of which I released as part of ReStaff
and others separately. Many of these were edited from RTP and so can only be used in
RPG Maker VX Ace.

Please credit me as: Matseb2611 or Matthew Ashworth (either way is fine).

The following resources also require you to credit Enterbrain:

- All Animated Battlers.
- All Characters except for Snowmen, Virtual Doors 1 and 2, $Debris, Firework Bursts 1 and 2, $Lurker, and Glowing Decorations.
- All Faces/Busts.
- All HUD Images.
- All Just Face It battlers.
- All Large Icons.
- All Tiles.
- All Windowskins.

For the Animated Battlers of Ogre and Demon King, you must also credit Marquise.


If you're confused with any of the resources and need help in getting them to work in-game,
feel free to send me a message and I'll be happy to help.

You can contact me (Matseb2611) via PM on RPG Maker Web, or by email at matthewseb2611@yahoo.co.uk.

Thank you and enjoy!
